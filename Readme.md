1) First you make a new txt file on your desktop
2) Then you just copy the text in: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RealSiesgo/KRNL_unexpected_client_kick-fix/main/fixboblos.bat
3) Paste the raw text on the txt file you created and save it
4) Then change text file extension to ".bat" instead of ".txt"
5) Run the file!

Info: you don't have to repeat all of these. You just run the file whenever your Roblox client gives you an unexpected client error.

If you still have issues contact krnl support.
